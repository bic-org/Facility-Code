# Rules for Geofencing

### Defining Geofences

When creating and using geofences that are shared and used across multiple parties it’s important to have a clear definition that everyone agrees to and that for common facilities there is a single source of truth, to achieve this we need to define the geofence and rules for easy review and understanding.

### Classification and Rules

During the creation process of geofences, it is key to define specific guidelines based on the type of facility.  Organizations such as BIC and SMDG each have distinct rules for the facilities for which they provide codes. Recognizing this differentiation, we will categorize each entity as a distinct ‘family’ in our framework.

Under this family classification system, a set of geofences would typically be defined, if its type aligns with the family’s, in the geofence review tool we focus on the following 2 code lists;

* **BIC Facility Codes** – depots and other container handling facilities&#x20;
* **SMDG Terminal Codes** - Ocean container and Roll-On/Roll-Off terminals &#x20;

Each of the above families could have different definitions and uses for geofencing and define their own rules for those locations.&#x20;

Heres an example outlining how BIC and SMDG facilities overlap within a port area, within Hamburg, SMDG have the Eurogate Terminal, within that terminal area there are two BIC Facilities (Eurokombi and SWOP Seaworth Packing)
