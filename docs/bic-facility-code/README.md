# BIC Facility Code

### Background&#x20;

The BIC Facility Code began life in the 1980s as the “LoCode” identifier under ISO 9897.  Now a “child code” of the UN/Locode, the BIC Facility Code is used to identify container facilities such as depots, container yards, container freight stations, M\&R vendors and other facilities in the container supply chain.  The BIC Facility Code is complementary to the SMDG Ocean Terminal Code, which is also a child code of the UN/Locode.  The BIC Facility Code covers container facility types _other_ than ocean terminals.

### Code Structure&#x20;

The BIC Facility Code is a 9 character code that identifies a container depot or facility, as it is a child code of the UN/LOCODE it identifies facilities by extending the 5 character UN/LOCODE to further identify container facilities.

Lets take an example to explain the structure:

**GBLIVJMDA**

The first 5 characters are the UN/LOCODE and describe a country and city/town

* **GB -** The ISO Country Code for the United Kingdom
* **LIV -** The code for Liverpool (in the UK)

The next 4 characters are assigned by the BIC to identify a container facility within that UN/LOCODE

* **JMDA**

NOTE: The BIC Code is never separated it is always presented as a 9 character combined code, so only **GBLIVJMDA** would be considered to be the BIC Facility Code.
