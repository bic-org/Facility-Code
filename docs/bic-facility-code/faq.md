## How can I request a BIC Facility Code for a facility?&#x20;

If you would like to request a BFC for a facility you can request a code to be assigned by visiting the BIC website and ['register a code'](https://www.bic-code.org/bic-facility-codes/bic-facility-code-registration-form/) if you have a code thats used today for data exchange and wish to request that there is the option to do so on the application form, otherwise a code will be assigned to your facility from the information you provide.

The BIC will verify the details provided and ensure that the details locate to a facility and street address and that it is not a duplication of an existing code.  You will then be notified once the code is active, and it will be available to industry immediately via the BIC website and the API.

## How can I request a SMDG Terminal Code?

SMDG manage the Ocean Terminal codes which are returned in the API, if you need a terminal code you can apply by visiting [http://www.smdg.org/smdg-code-lists/](http://www.smdg.org/smdg-code-lists/) and return the application form. &#x20;

## How can I request to update a facility details?

If you find that a facility detail is incorrect please notify us by the following means:

**BIC Facility Code:** Contact bfc@bic-code.org and provide the correct details for the facility in question.

**SMDG Terminal Code:** Contact [coderequest@smdg.org](mailto:coderequest@smdg.org) providing information about the Terminal code in question.

## How do we remove a facility from the list?

If a facility is known to be closed please report to [bic@bic-code.org](mailto:bic@bic-code.org) and we will add a 'validity end date' to the dataset, discussion on how to best communicate this change will be raised as a git issue and discussed with the user community.

## A Facility appears twice in the code list?

Whilst we take care to remove duplicates or where facilities have been known by different names there are occasions where a facility maybe listed more than once, and there could be a reason for this where a different code is required for a different purposes, we do review the BFC list on a regular basis to minimise these occurrences.

However if a facility appears to be duplicated in the code list please notify bic@bic-code.org and identify the two facility codes in question that point at the same facility.  They will be reviewed and one of the codes will follow the [alias procedure](alias-codes.md) which will remove it from the active facility code list. &#x20;
